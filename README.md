# PassProtecter

## What is it?

PassProtecter is an app for governing personal passwords.

This is like the KeyPass application but one for the Android platform.

## How do I use it?

At the start of the program, it asks for the password file where your passwords are stored in encrypted form.

You may also create one such file if you do not already have one or if you want to use another one.

The password file consists of a main password and a list of passwords.

To use the selected password file, the user gives its main password which opens all the other passwords.

The user can then see a list of their passwords for the service they have made them.


This modularity allows the user to carry multiple password files and also allows to transfer such files from one platform to another.

## Security

The passwords are encrypted using this library: https://github.com/hummatli/MAHEncryptorLib

It uses DES-encryption and hopefully that library will be changed to a much more secure one.
